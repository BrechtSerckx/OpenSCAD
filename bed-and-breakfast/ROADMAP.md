bed-and-breakfast is steadily in development.
The goal is a version 1.0 which features (only features that are
not implemented yet are enumerated here):

* Several matrix decomposition methods
  * LU / LUP decomposition
  * QR decomposition using Gram-Schmidt
  * Singular Value Decomposition

* Computation of Eigenvalues

* Proper support for complex matrices

* Transform matrices into different forms
  * Triangular (upper, lower)
  * Hessenberg (upper, lower)
  * Tridiagonal
  * Diagonal

* Better support for vectors (currently these are just 1xN or Mx1 matrices)
  * Dot product
  * Vector product
  * Outer product
